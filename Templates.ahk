; The basic gist is that each department tab has an array for the first dropdown and and array of arrays for the second dropdown.
; Each item in the first dropdowns arrays has an associated map containing key-value pairs. The keys in these pairs correlate with the items in the associated template array.
;
; The main script uses the two selected dropdown options to pull the value from the key-value pair and output it to a text field.
